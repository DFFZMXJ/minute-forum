## I don't recommed you to use

This forum is just let me show you my techonology, I don't recommed you to use this software because:

* If too many users submitted data at same time, JSON database may occure errors.
* No administration tools based, you can't manage posts with user interface.
* Doesn't support tags and categories, you can't category posts.
* Doesn't support pages, if too many posts and replies existed, browser maybe crash. (No matter how your computer's performance good)
* No XSS protection and evil HTML filter, users will break the forum by changig the script.(e.g. send cookies to another server with AJAX.)

You can improve this software easily, because it's too simple!
